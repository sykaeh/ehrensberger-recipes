tags: cookies
cook: 12 - 14 minutes per sheet
yield: 30 cookies
source: Rachael Crawley
ingredients: |-
  3 cups powdered sugar
  2/3 cup unsweetened Hershey’s dark chocolate cocoa powder
  1/8 tsp. salt
  2 to 4 large egg whites, at room temperature
  1 Tbsp. pure vanilla extract
  1 1/2 cups 60% cacao chocolate chips

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Set aside two baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar with cocoa powder and salt.
4. Whisk in the vanilla and egg whites starting with just two.
5. Beat just until the batter is moistened. You’re looking for a brownie-like, thick and fudgy batter consistency. If it seems too thick, add another egg white– then a 4th one if it still seems too thick.
6. Stir in the chocolate chips.
7. Scoop the batter by the tablespoon full onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave enough space between each cookie for them to spread.
8. Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the tops are glossy and lightly cracked.
9. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet and store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
