In a deep bowl, combine the cucumbers, tomatoes, onion and green pepper, garlic and crumbled bread.  Mix thoroughly.  Add water, vinegar, olive oil and salt.  Ladle the mixture into a blender or food processor, puree, and then pour into another large bowl.  I sometimes puree twice.  

Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours.
