  3 C  cooked/canned* garbanzo beans, with reserved liquid

  1 T butter or oil

  1 t ground coriander

  1 t ground cumin

  3/8 t cinnamon

  3 cloves garlic, minced

  ½ t ground ginger (or grated fresh)

  salt to taste

  2T lemon juice, or more to taste (= ½ lemon)

  1 T chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste

  1 firm tomato, cut into ½-inch dice


  *To cook dried garbanzo beans: Soak the beans overnight in enough water to keep them covered, with a pinch of baking soda in it. Add more water the next day, if needed, salt it well, and bring to a boil. 

  Reduce the heat and simmer the beans until they are tender, about 1-1 ½ hours, then drain and use as directed. (Note: If cooked without presoaking, extend the cooking time by an extra ½ to 1 hour.)

Melt better in saucepan over low heat and stir in the spices; allow them to heat, stirring often, for a few minutes. 

Stir in the garbanzo beans and enough of the reserved liquid to  just barely cover them. Stir well and mash a few of the beans with  a fork or potato masher.

Cook the beans over medium heat for about 20 minutes, or until the sauce is quite thick, stirring often. Remove from heat.

Stir in the lemon juice, the chopped cilantro, and the diced tomato. Taste and correct the seasoning.
