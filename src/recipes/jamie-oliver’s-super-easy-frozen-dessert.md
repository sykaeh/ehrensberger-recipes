title: Jamie Oliver’s Super Easy Frozen Dessert
tags: dessert
language: en
source: Tracey
ingredients: >-
  1 bag of frozen fruit (I used mixed berries, but I also bought a bag of frozen
  cherries at the Italian Centre that we will try the next time we have guests)

  650 g plain yoghourt 

  2-3 T honey (Jamie recommends 4-5 T, but Brits usually make things too sweet, so I cut it back)

Put the berries in the food processor and cut them up

Add the yoghourt and honey to the berries – whip them up. 

Serve.  There were 4 of us and we all had seconds!  So refreshing and so easy – and no sugar except for the honey. 

Next time I would take the bag of fruit out of the freezer as we sit down to dinner to let it defrost a little bit.  But it was a terrific dessert!
