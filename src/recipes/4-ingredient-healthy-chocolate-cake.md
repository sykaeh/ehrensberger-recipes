1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease the interior of a 6 inch springform pan and then line with parchment paper.

2. Add dates to a food processor and blend until a smooth paste forms. The dates should pull away from the sides of the food processor and form a ball. If you are using a fresh package of very soft mejdool dates, you can just blend them as they are. If your dates feel a bit firm or dry, you will need to rehydrate them before using. To do so, soak them in warm water for about 15 minutes. Then lightly pat dry and use.

3. Once date paste forms, add in the cocoa powder and blend until fully incorporated.

4. Add in baking powder and eggs. Blend until smooth. You will need to scrape down your batter a few times and you may want to alternate between pulsing and processing to make sure all of the dates are blended. It can take several minutes to make your batter smooth. Very tiny bits of dates can remain but you don't want too many date pieces because then you'll just taste the dates in your cake.

5. Pour cake into prepared pan. Bake for about 30-35 minutes. A toothpick inserted should come out mostly clean. It's okay if your batter is not fully set. You don't want to overbake the cake. Let cake cool completely before serving. The cake will deflate slightly as it cools.
