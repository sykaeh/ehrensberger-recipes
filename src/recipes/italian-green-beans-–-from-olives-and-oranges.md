ingredients: >-
  ¼ Cup plus 2 T extra-virgin olive oil

  ½ C whole raw almonds

  1 t fleur de sel or other medium course sea salt

  1 small red onion, thinly sliced


  ½ cup loosely packed fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves

Heat 2 T of olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add almonds and cook, shaking pan back and forth occasionally, until nuts are golden and start to pop – about 4 minutes (beans are excellent even without this step). 

Remove from heat, sprinkle with ½ t salt and stir.  Remove nuts from oil with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels, then coarsely chop.  

Bring a large saucepan of well-salted water to boil.  Add beans and cook until crisp-tender – about 5 minutes.  Drain, transfer to a large bowl, and immediately toss beans with remaining ¼ cup oil and ½ t salt.  

Add cheese, onion, parsley and toss well.  Let sit for a few minutes, then toss with almonds and serve.
