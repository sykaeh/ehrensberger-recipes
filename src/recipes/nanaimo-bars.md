Butter an 8 by 8-inch baking dish.

**For the first layer:** Mix all the ingredients together and bake at 175 for 10 minutes.

Alternatively, use the stovetop method: Melt butter in large heat proof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water set over medium-low heat. Remove from heat, add in sugar, cocoa powder and salt and whisk until well combined. While whisking vigorously, very slowly pour in beaten egg in a thin stream. Return mixture to heat and cook until mixture has just thickened. Remove from heat and add in graham cracker crumbs, coconut, and almonds and toss until evenly coated.

Press mixture into prepared baking dish. Chill while preparing the filling, bottom layer shouldn't be warm when adding the custard frosting layer.

**For the second layer:** mix powdered sugar, butter, custard/pudding powder and 2 Tbsp heavy cream and beat until very pale and fluffy (add another 1 Tbsp cream to thin if needed). Spread mixture into an even layer over the bottom layer. Chill preferably in the freezer while melting chocolate (otherwise the warm chocolate can melt this layer).

**For the third layer:** Melt semi-sweet chocolate along with butter in a heatproof bowl, set over a pot of simmering water, or in a small pot on low heat until smooth. Spread mixture into an even layer over the second layer (spread quickly before chocolate begins to set). Chill until the chocolate layer has set.

ENJOY!
