Sprinkle both sides of the eggplant slices with salt (to draw out their moisture) and spread them out in one layer on a platter or board. After 20-30 minutes, pat the eggplant dry with paper towels.

Heat the butter or oil in a heavy 10- to 12-inch skillet over low-medium heat and sauté the onion until soft but not brown, about 5 mins. Add the eggplant slices, mixing them with the onion. 

Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and season with the pepper and sugar.

 Cover the pan with a lid and simmer gently for 30 mins, correcting seasoning if necessary.
