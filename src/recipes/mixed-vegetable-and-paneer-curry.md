1. Heat oil in a wide pan. Add chopped onions, and fry for some time.Add ginger-garlic paste, and green chili. Fry till the onions turn slightly brown.
   Add chopped tomatoes or homemade tomato paste. Mix well and fry till oil floats on top.
2. Add all the spices, stir, and add the mixed vegetables. Add a little water, cover, and cook till all the vegetables are tender. 
3. Add cashew paste, and a little more water to get a nice gravy consistency.
       Add the paneer cubes, and kasoori methi crushed if using. 
4. Cover and cook for a few minutes. Check for salt and add more if needed. Garnish with cilantro/coriander leaves. The gravy will thicken because of the cashew paste, you can add a little more water to thin it out. Switch off heat and serve hot with Rice, Naan, Paratha, or Roti.
