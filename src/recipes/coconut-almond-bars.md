Combine the ingredients for the shortbread base, using a pastry cutter or two knives to mix. Bake in a square or rectangular cake pan @175C for 10 minutes.

While the base is baking, mix the ingredients for the topping. The bars are also good if only the coconut or the almond is used, but best with both :-) Bake @ 175C for 25 minutes longer.

Let cool completely before cutting and eating (this is the hardest part of the recipe!).
